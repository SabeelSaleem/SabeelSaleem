I am a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering and Physics student at Portland State University. 
My passion lies in innovating existing technology to make it better and more efficient as well as finding new concepts to bring into practical use. 
I am a believer that research and engineering should be affordable and accessible to everyone which pushes me to find and develop alternative solutions to expensive or proprietary machines and measuring devices. 
I am also a student of the Portland State University Honors College, where I have improved my technical writing and research skills. 

I've had the opportunity to learn about more advanced topics such as: 
- Semiconductor manufacturing processes
- High vacuum chambers and their design and functionality
- Flow control systems with various gases driven by data acquisition boards and other components

Along with that, I've also had hands on experience with various metrology related equipment including electron microscopes and dual-beams. 
My time at the Electronics Prototyping Lab has vastly improved my mechatronics understanding that stems from:
- Fixing, Calibrating, and Improving various machines
- Assisting students with rapid prototyping using 3D printers, PCB mills, and other equipment.

In addition to my technical skills, I am continually looking for ways to improve and innovate within my field. 
My journey in Mechanical Engineering and Physics has been an exciting one. 
I hope to continue my studies with diligence and eventually contribute to something more.
